Project Description:
Crayonify is a project to make sure you'll never be impacted by copyright claims
on JoJo's characters ever again. Now you may ask, why would we need to dodge 
copyright claims on JoJo's characters? Well, some of our most beloved characters
in JoJo's, such as "Filthy Acts at a Reasonable Price" stem from songs as 
fabulous and fantastic as "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap". This project, in some 
ways, a revolutionary product, will vastly increase the rate at which JoJo's
stands can be created. By creating glorious translations of your favorite 
phrases in the color of C O M M U N I S M, you can generate as much quality
literature in little to no time. Indeed the rate will increase to an almost 
unfathomable level. As a side note, if you want to ransom off a politician, 
this will also accomplish the task at hand. In order to further develop 
the potential of this latter feature, we've channeled the chaotic and profound 
energy of our beloved David Scott Kosbie, the Angel of Carpe Diem and he who 
bleeds Tartan, in order to provide payment confirmation after you get your 
due ransom in hand. Notice, furthermore, that with our code, YOU, have the 
power to GET SIMP. But wait, there's more: all elements of this project 
will D Y N A M I C A L L Y S C A L E with changes in window size.
